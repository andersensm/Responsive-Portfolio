        <!-- Profile picture & biography -->
        <p class="pSpecial"><img src="assets/images/ProfilePicture.png" alt="Profile Picture" class="ProfilePicture" />I was born in Nebraska, but I grew up in the Northern Virginia Area. I was lucky enough to have lots of family close by that I could spend time with, and
          the rest of my extended family is speard out across the United States. As I grew up, I loved to play soccer with my friends and Virginia's organized soccer leagues; Go Kiwanis!!. I went to school in Arlington, VA and did my undergraduate degree
          at George Mason University with a major in Geography and minor in Geographic Information Systems.</p>
        <p class="pSpecial">
          I've been married for 5 years, to a wonderful wife and we have two beautiful girls; 1 and 3 years old. We love to go to the beach in the summer. We make sand castles, go boogey boarding, fly kites, and snorkle. About every two years, as a family, we go
          to Disney World in Orlando, FL. and we have the time of our lives. When we aren't spending time on vacation, we hang out with family and friends from our neighborhood. When family and friends aren't around, I enjoy coding and learning new things!
